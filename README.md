# CAR-PRICE-PREDICTION-USING-ML


Project: Car Price Prediction Model
Problem Statement
The price of a car depends on numerous factors, including the brand, features, horsepower, mileage, and many more. Accurately predicting car prices is a significant challenge in the field of machine learning. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the price of a car based on various features. By analyzing historical data, the model will learn patterns and relationships between different car attributes and their corresponding prices, allowing for accurate price predictions on new data.

Objective
The objective of this project is to develop a regression model that can predict car prices with high accuracy. The model will be trained on a dataset containing various features of cars and their prices. This project will involve data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

Dataset
The dataset contains information about various cars, including features such as:

Car brand
Model
Year of manufacture
Engine power (horsepower)
Mileage
Fuel type
Transmission type
Owner type
Selling price
The dataset is provided in a CSV file named car data.csv.

Implementation Steps
Data Loading and Exploration:

Load the dataset and explore its structure.
Check for missing values and handle them appropriately.
Data Preprocessing:

Encode categorical variables into numerical formats.
Standardize the features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Train-Test Split:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance on unseen data.
Model Training:

Train a linear regression model using the training data.
Consider experimenting with other regression models such as decision trees, random forests, or gradient boosting to compare performance.
Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (RÂ²) score.
Plot the true vs. predicted car prices to visually assess the model's performance.
Model Deployment (Optional):

Deploy the model as a web service using Flask or FastAPI, allowing users to input car features and receive price predictions.
